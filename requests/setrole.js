If you happen to remove a role and add a new role, this will allow you to update the roles without restarting the bot!\n\n(Worth noting, you should probably update and restart the bot.)\n\n**roleNames:**\n- looking\n- available\n-inGame\nThese don't have to match what your discord roles are. This is just what the bot uses to recognize them.\n\n**roleId:**\nTo get a role Id, mention the role with a slash in front like:\n\`\`\`\n\\@available\n\`\`\`\nThis should display the roleId as a long number. Just use the name and id with this command, and you'll be good to go!`)

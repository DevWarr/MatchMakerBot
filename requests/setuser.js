If you happen to remove a user and add a new user, this will allow you to update the users without restarting the bot!\n\n(Worth noting, you should probably update and restart the bot.)\n\n**userNames:**\n- bot(unchangeable)\n- WarVDine(Bot creator, unchangeable)\n- admin(changeable)\nYes, only the admin user id can be changed. Furthermore, the admin and WarVDine are the ONLY two users who can use these special commands. **_Use at your own risk._**\n\n**userId:**\nTo get a user Id, mention the user with a slash in front like:\n\`\`\`\n\\@admin\nor\n\\@[Inset admin's username here]\n\`\`\`\nThis should display the userId as a long number. Just use the name and id with this command, and you'll be good to go!`)
